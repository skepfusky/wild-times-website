#  Wild Times website

A website for a chill and SFW furry server, **Wild Times!** But you may ask, why would you make a website for a Discord server? Well, firstly, to learn more on building apps (or terrible apps/website) using a JavaScript framework, Vue.js, since having an understandable knowledge if HTML, CSS, and barely any JavaScript at all lol

And secondly, it may seem silly to make a website from a Discord server but I've met and talked to a lot of cool and awesome people there so far!

## Some stuff used
Unless anyone's a developer or as *really* tech-savvy as I am, no one would care but if you're curious - yes, this site is built using the latest version of Vue, version 3 through Vue CLI and some other dependencies such as FontAwesome and Google Fonts.

It also uses a CSS pre-processor, Sass or SCSS, to provide more flexibility and efficiency when it comes to web design. More specifically, I used "dart-sass" because **y e s**.
