#  Wild Times website
**UPDATE: I am no longer working on this website anymore as of Dec 14, as I personally don't feel like working on it anymore, and I have no contact to the mods and the owner to have access to their server IDs.**

A website for a chill and SFW furry server, **Wild Times!** But you may ask, why would you make a website for a Discord server? Well, firstly, to learn more on building apps (or terrible apps/website) using a JavaScript framework, Vue.js, since having an understandable knowledge if HTML, CSS, and barely any JavaScript at all lol

And secondly, yes, it may seem silly to make a website from a Discord server but I've met and talked to a lot of cool and awesome people there so far!

This site is built using Vue 3 and some other dependencies such as FontAwesome and Google Fonts, uses a CSS pre-processor, Sass/SCSS to provide more flexibility and efficiency for web design.
